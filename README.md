# Wind Speed Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting wind speed using machine learning techniques. Accurate wind speed prediction is crucial for various applications, including renewable energy management, weather forecasting, and aviation safety.

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Utilizes historical weather data to train predictive models.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares data for analysis, handling missing values and outliers.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts relevant features influencing wind speed, such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.
- **Modeling**: Implements machine learning algorithms to forecast wind speed.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assesses model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**
   - Sources historical weather data from reliable meteorological databases.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handles missing data through imputation techniques.
   - Normalizes or standardizes data to ensure uniformity.

3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Analyzes correlations between potential predictors and wind speed.
   - Creates new features or transforms existing ones to improve model accuracy.

4. **Modeling**
   - Splits data into training and testing sets.
   - Trains models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
   - Tunes hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

5. **Evaluation**
   - Uses cross-validation to ensure model robustness.
   - Evaluates models based on error metrics and selects the best-performing model.

## Dataset

- **Source**: Historical weather data obtained from meteorological organizations or online repositories.
- **Description**: Includes variables like temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and historical wind speeds.
